# Credit-Score-Prediction-using-ML-Models

Credit Risk assessment is a crucial issue faced by Banks nowadays which helps them to evaluate if a loan applicant can be a defaulter at a later stage so that they can go ahead and 
grant the loan or not. This helps the banks to minimize the possible losses and can increase the volume of credits. Nowadays there are many risks related to bank loans, especially for 
the banks so as to reduce their capital loss. The analysis of risks and assessment of default becomes crucial thereafter. Banks hold huge volumes of customer behavior related data from 
which they are unable to arrive at a judgement if an applicant can be defaulter or not.

So the idea of this project is to gather loan data from multiple data sources and use various machine learning algorithms on this data to extract important information. This model can 
be used by the organizations in making the right decision to approve or reject the loan request of the customers. In this paper, we examine a real bank credit data and conduct several 
machine learning algorithms on the data for that determine credit worthiness of customers to formulate bank risk automated system.
